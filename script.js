//// CODING CHALLENGE

//DOGS ARRAY
const dogs = [
  { weight: 22, curFood: 250, owners: ["Alice", "Bob"] },
  { weight: 8, curFood: 200, owners: ["Matilda"] },
  { weight: 13, curFood: 275, owners: ["Sarah", "John"] },
  { weight: 32, curFood: 340, owners: ["Michael"] },
];

console.log(`Hello`);

//TASK 1
// Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate
// the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do
// not create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla:
// recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of
// food, and the weight needs to be in kg)

dogs.forEach((dog) => (dog.recFood = Math.trunc(dog.weight ** 0.75 * 28)));

console.log(dogs);

//TASK 2
// Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too
// little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in
// the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) ðŸ¤“

const dogSarah = dogs.find((dog) => dog.owners.includes("Sarah"));
console.log(dogSarah);

console.log(
  `Sarah's dog is eating too ${
    dogSarah.curFood > dogSarah.recFood ? "much" : "little"
  } `
);

///TASK3
// Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
// ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little
// ('ownersEatTooLittle').

const ownersEatTooMuch = dogs
  .filter((dog) => dog.curFood > dog.recFood)
  .map((dog) => dog.owners)

const ownersEatTooLittle = dogs
  .filter((dog) => dog.curFood < dog.recFood)
  .map((dog) => dog.owners)
  .flat();
console.log(ownersEatTooLittle);

//TASK4
// Log a string to the console for each array created in TASK3., like this: "Matilda and
// Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat
// too little!"

console.log(`${ownersEatTooMuch.join(" and ")}'s dogs eat too much!`);
console.log(`${ownersEatTooLittle.join(" and ")}'s dogs eat too little!`);

//TASK5
// Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food
// that is recommended (just true or false)

console.log(dogs.some((dog) => dog.curFood === dog.recFood));

//TASK 6
// Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food
// (just true or false)

const checkEatingOkay = (dog) =>
  dog.curFood > dog.recFood * 0.9 && dog.curFood < dog.recFood * 1.1;

console.log(dogs.some(checkEatingOkay));

//TASK7
// Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food (try
//   to reuse the condition used in 6.)

console.log(dogs.filter(checkEatingOkay));

//TASK8
// Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food
// portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the
// array's objects ðŸ˜‰)

const dogsSorted = dogs.slice().sort((a, b) => a.recFood - b.recFood);
console.log(dogsSorted);
